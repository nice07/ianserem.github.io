          <p>There are two different types of writing: High-quality writing and Low-quality writing.
            High-quality writing leads to better lead generation, more effective sales copy, and improved online
            visibility. But low-quality writing on the other hand, has the opposite effect.
            Which means that if you’re not careful and thorough enough, you may end up hiring a writer who promises you
            the world, but delivers poor writing in the end.
            So, if you’re looking for a great copywriter or content writer for your business or website, you must ensure
            that he/she writes high-quality work.</p>

          <p>Writing is inarguably one of the most remarkable things humankind ever figured out. The ability to piece
            words together so beautifully, to tell stories, record history, teach lessons, and offer knowledge- just to
            mention a few- is nothing short of art. Pure, magnificent, genius art that has been passed down from
            generation to generation.

        <h1>Choosing a Subject</h1>
        <p>Often, of course you are not free to choose at all. You must compose a report for a business meeting or write
          on an assigned topic for an English class. The problem then becomes not what to write about but how to attack it.
          Some people like to work through a subject systematically, uncovering topics by asking questions. Others preffer a less
          structured, less analytical upproach, a kind of brainstorming. When you can select a  subject for yourself, it ought to interest you, and interst others
          as well, at least potentially. It should be within the range of your experience and skill, though it is best if it strethes you. It ought to be neither so 
          vast that no one person can encompass it nor so narrow and trivial that no one cares.
          Don't be afraid to express your own opinions and feelings. You are a vital part of the subject. No matter what the topic, you are really writing about how you
          understand it, how you feel about it. Good writing has personality. Readers enjoy sensing a mind at work, hearing a clear voice, responding to an unusual
          sensibility. If you have chosen a topic that of general concern, and if a genuine feeeling and intelligence come through, you will be interesting. Intrest
          lies not so much in a topic as in in what a writer has made of it.</p>
